1.Select corpus from selection box.
2.On selecting particular corpus you will get that particular corpus on the screen.
3.Then we will get 2 text boxes to enter data i.e, no.of tokens and types.
4.If we give wrong data it chnage text boxes to red colour and display as wrong and if we gave correct input then it will display as correct.
5.Next we need to reduce this corpus with help of stemmer and reduce it.
6.And then calculate total types and give it as input if it is correct it will show it as correct.
These are the different functionalities to be worked in this experiment.
